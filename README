Note:
The final version of the code, (MysteryofFinchManor.py,) contains most comments and detailing
of who did what work. It can be said with certainty that the project was equal in effort, and we
all did an equal amount of code. It may seem that one person did less code in one area, but each of
us had parts of advanced code that took more time to write, therefore balancing out the workload.
